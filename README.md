// Important Notice

// Continuation LESSON 7: Hardhat fundme ---> continuation from 11:08:36 Testing Fund Me which is the 
// repository hardhat-fund-me-fcc

// i created another repository similar to -> hardhat-fund-me-fcc
// because am having issues with running test

// so what i intended in this repository is that, i will use the repository from the lesson 7 section by
// cloning it, since the test is working perfectly. i concluded with this because i have done everything 
// possible by creating different repository and testing them to see where the fault is from.
// so i guess it will be the package version currently is not compactable with the code in the lession 7

// so what i will do is that i will cotinue from the last repository which is --> 11:08:36 Testing Find Me
